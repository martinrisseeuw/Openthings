	<h2>Project description</h2>
	<p>hopBot PartWorks is a user-friendly CAD/CAM design program that takes you from laying out your design to producing a ShopBot Part File, ready to cut on your tool.  PartWorks is the easiest-to-use and quickest-to-learn 2.5D design and CNC machining software product on the market.  It gives you accurate design tools, impressive toolpathing functionality and dazzling 3D previews all wrapped up in the a simple, intuitive interface.  It is an excellent starting point for a any new CNC router owner.</p>

	<p>Several years ago we recognized that one of the most difficult aspects of robotic tools for people new to the technology was the process of turning a project concept into the computer toolpath file that guides the motion of cutting or machining.  That's why, with the help of the Vectric software team we have created PartWorks (and PartWorks 3D) and include it with every new ShopBot tool.</p>
