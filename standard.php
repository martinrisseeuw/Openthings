				<h1>About openThings</h1>
				<h2>What are we?</h2>
				<p><strong>A platform for creating open source design together</strong></p>
				
				<h2>Why?</h2>
				<p>The idea to create a platform for open design sharing arose during the Fab10 conference in Barcelona. Johannes Fischer  and Martin Risseeuw noticed that there was a demand for a platform where people could document their work and share their knowledge so they could learn from each other.</p>

<p>Both Johannes and Martin where know in the development culture where knowledge sharing is very common. The goal of us is to bring this culture to the design and makers movement. </p>
				
				<h2>How?</h2>
				<p>openThings is very inspired by other great platforms such as: stackoverflow, github, wikipedia, behance. We want to take different elements of all these projects to have a platform where people can design together like github does for software developers. Share designs like behance and discuss and ask questions like stackoverflow.</p>
